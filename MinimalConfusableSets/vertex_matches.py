"""
Vertex matches have an even number of +1 and and odd number of -1 entries, and others zero. Their total number of entries is M, the numnber of bad bats.

"Useful" vertex matches have at least k+1 non-zero entries (because all sums of <=k linearly dependent non-zero things in k-dimes are non-zero).

A "canonical" vertex match is one where the elements in the tuple never decrease reading left to right. E.g., if all position are equivalent, then (1,1,-1,-1,-1,0) is a canonical match.

Sometimes it is not worth permuting vertex matches over every bad bat because other matches in the existing context may not yet have broken any symmetries between the bats.

E.g. if the first two places are different to each other (and to any other place) but the last four places are all equivalent to each other, then one need only consider these orderings of the letters "Speedo" in that context:

    Sp.eedo
    Se.pedo
    Sd.peeo
    So.peed

    pS.eedo
    pe.Sedo
